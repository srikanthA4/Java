Encapsulation:-

def:- Encapsulation is the proce3ss of wrapping data and code into a single unit, usually a class, and restriciting direct acess yo some of the objects components.

in simnple way we can say as keep your fields private and provide public getter and setter methods to access/update them.

Uses:- 
1. Protectsdata from unauthorized access
2. provides control over data.
3. Improves modularity and maintainability
4. Makes code easier to refractor.


Excample:- for example the ATM Ui(methods) lets you intract with your account(data).

but you canot directly acess the data inside- its encapsulated for safty 

Final points:- 

*Encapsulation = data + methods bundled together
* Use private+getter/setters
* Improves secrity, modularity, and maintainbility 


Mainly encapuslation will hides the data
