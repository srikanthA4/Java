Polymorphism:- menas many forms

Def:- Polymorphism in Java is a concept where one action can behave differently based on the context. It allows objects to take on multiple forms, making code more flexible and reusable.

java supports 2 types 1. compile-time polymorphism(method overloading)
2. Runtime polymorphism (mehtod overriding)

Uses:- 1. improves code reuasbility
2. Promotes flexibility and maintianability
3. supports dyanmic method dispatch


1. compile-time polymorphism:- When multiple methods in ths same class hava same name but different parameters. it's called method overloadfing.

2. Runtime polumorphism:- When a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass, it's called method overriding. it is resolved at runtime.

Note: 
1. Polymorphism is one of the 4 OOP pillars (along with inheritance, Encapsulation, abstraction)
2. method overloading = compile time
3. method overriding= Runtime
4. Polymorphism Enables dynamic method dispatch
