Interface in java

Def: An interface in is a buleprint of a class. It is used to achieve 100% abstraction (untill java 7), anf it only contains abstract methods(until java 8) and constants 

Interfaces can have: default methods(with body)
static methods (with body)
but still cannot have instsance fields or constructors

Use interfaces:- To achieve abstraction , To support multiple inheritance, to define contracts for subclasses to implement.
