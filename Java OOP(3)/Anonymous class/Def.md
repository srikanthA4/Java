Anonymous Class in Java

Def:- An anonymous class is a class without a name, defined and instantiated at the same time. It is used to create a one time subclass implementation of an interface or abstract class. 


Advantages:- Compact and concise
             ideal for short, one-time logic 
             Reduce boilerplate code 

DisAdvantages:- Cannot resuse the class
                Can make code hard to read if overused.

Use Cases:- 

1. Event listeners in GUI apps
2. Short-lived threads and tasks
3. Ouick override of methods
